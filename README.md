## Project: Deploying EVM Subnet on Avalanche with Solidity Smart Contracts

This project aims to guide you through deploying an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) subnet on Avalanche, deploying Solidity smart contracts using Remix, and interacting with them using Metamask.

## Step-by-Step Guide:

### 1. Deploy your EVM subnet using the Avalanche CLI:
   - Follow Avalanche's documentation on deploying an EVM subnet using the Avalanche CLI.
   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions and resources to deploy a subnet.

### 2. Add your Subnet to Metamask:
   - Open Metamask in your web browser.
   - Click on the network selection dropdown.
   - Choose "Custom RPC" and add the details of your deployed EVM subnet.

### 3. Make sure it is your selected network in Metamask:
   - Once added, ensure your deployed EVM subnet is selected as the active network in Metamask.

### 4. Connect Remix to your Metamask:
   - Open Remix in your web browser.
   - Choose the "Injected Web3" option to connect Remix to Metamask.
   - This allows Remix to interact with the Metamask wallet on your selected network.

### 5. Deploy the smart contracts:
   - Write your Solidity smart contracts or use existing ones.
   - Compile your contracts in Remix.
   - Deploy them using the Metamask connection to your deployed EVM subnet.

### 6. Test your application:
   - Use Remix to interact with your deployed smart contracts.
   - Deploy tokens, pools, or any other components of your application.
   - Test the functionality and ensure everything works as expected.

### Tools Used:
- Unix Computer (MacOS or Linux)
- Solidity
- Remix
- Metamask
- Web Browser
- Avalanche CLI

### Notes:
- Make sure you have the necessary permissions and resources to deploy an EVM subnet on Avalanche.
- Ensure proper network configurations in both Metamask and Remix to connect to your deployed subnet.
- Test thoroughly to ensure all components of your application work as intended.
